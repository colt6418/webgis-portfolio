# Welcome to my portfolio!
_For my portfolio, I will displaying three different assignments from the semester and demonstrate how I've improved them._

## Production Assignment #1: My First Web App

For our first production assignment, I decided to use the example data that was provided to us to produce a web app. This web app shows the locations of several wineries across Vermont and New Hampshire. While this ended up being a fairly decent map, it had virtually no interactivity.

Since this was the very first project I figured this would be the perfect oppurtinity to go back and improve it now that I have a full semester of webGIS under my belt.



## Production Assignment #7: Mapbox

One of my favorite assignments we've done this semester was the Production Assignment #7, especially since I was able to use my own data. For this assignment, I decided to make a map of different pianos I've located on campus. I made this map because I figured it would be cool to have an organized map of all of the pianos on campus, as well as their availability. I gathered all of the data myself; asking around to discover new pianos, tracking down the exact location of each piano, and testing them myself. The map I made for this assignment has the pianos I've located so far, which give a popup displaying information about each piano:

- Name of the location
- Availibility of the piano
- Type of piano
- Additional notes on the piano

I believe that this map is pretty adequate as it is, but I've decided to add new features to make it better.

## Production Assignment #8: Making a Survey

For the third assignment I would like to look at a something a little different, being a method I learned to gather spatial data from a collective group of people. In Prouction Assignment #8, we learned how to make surveys to collect data - including spatial data - from the public. This allows me to expand upon the previous assignment so that I can easily let people add information on differnt pianos across campus. For the sake of giving an example of what this collected data would look like, I filled out the survey with the data I had previously collected and used in Production Assignment #8.

The original survey allowed the participant to input the location of the piano through either their current location, or the more likely option of submitting a point on the map of the piano's location. Other required questions on the survey include:

- Type of piano
- Public availability of the piano

Additional optional Questions include:

- Specification on piano type if the user selected either 'Upright' or 'Grand'
- Specificatoin on permission required if the user specified the accessability as 'Special Access Required'
- Any extra notes they want to include about the piano

I made most of the questions optional because I wanted to include options to include more details about the pianos, while trying not to deter people from submitting enough information that would allow me to track the piano myself to gather any additional data I need.

While I believe that this survey sufficiently serves its purpose, I've found ways that I can improve it. For one, I added a link to a map of the submitted data so people can easily check which spots have been submitted already to avoid double submissions, or even if they're just curious. I've also added an 'other' option that allows the user to type in
