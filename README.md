# Welcome to my portfolio!
_For my portfolio, I will displaying three different assignments from the semester and demonstrate how I've improved them._

## Production Assignment #1: My First Web App

For our first production assignment, I decided to use the example data that was provided to us to produce a web app. This web app shows the locations of several wineries across Vermont and New Hampshire. While this ended up being a fairly decent map, it had virtually no interactivity.

Check out a live version of the original web app <a href="https://umass-amherst.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/sidebar/index.html?appid=47d34172b1534044830d4b527b67c8ef">here</a>.

Since this was the very first project I figured this would be the perfect oppurtinity to go back and improve it now that I have a full semester of webGIS under my belt.



## Production Assignment #7: Mapbox

One of my favorite assignments we've done this semester was the Production Assignment 7, especially since I was able to use my own data. For this assignment, I decided to make a map of different pianos I've located on campus. I made this map because I figured it would be cool to have an organized map of all of the pianos on campus, as well as their availability. I gathered all of the data myself; asking around to discover new pianos, tracking down the exact location of each piano, and testing them myself. The map I made for this assignment has the pianos I've located so far, which give a popup displaying information about each piano:

- Name of the location
- Availibility of the piano
- Type of piano
- Additional notes on the piano

  

I believe that this map is pretty adqquate as it is, but I've decided to add new features to make it better.



## Production Assignment #8: Making a Survey
